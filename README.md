# Natural Language Processing

This repository includes three programs designed to solve natural language processing
(NLP) related problems.

This is done in order to gain a better understanding of these NLP related topics. Descriptions
for each of the three files are detailed below:


**Bigram**
This program builds a word-based bigram model from a given training corpus and shows all
the unigram/bigram counts and probabilities of the model. This built model can then be used
for computing the bigram based probability of a given test sentence.


**Tagging**
This program builds a part of speech (POS) tagging model from a given training corpus
and displays all bigram counts and probabilities of the model. This built model can
then be used for POS tagging a given test sentence.


**Viterbi**
Runs the Viterbi algorithm to predict the most likely tag sequence of a test sentence
given the hidden markov model (HMM), tags, and observations.
